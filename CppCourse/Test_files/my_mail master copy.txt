Sounds good to me :-)

I know it's cheeky, but is there a chance we can bring Jon along too? I
think he's got a few questions about the auditorium that I'm sure he'd
like to ask you.

It's okay if you'd rather not :-)

Dear All,

Terry the plumber will be at the house tomorrow morning around 9.00am to =
replace all the shower thermostats in the house. Since several of you =
have said the showers go hot/cold while you are under them, he thinks =
the individual thermostatic valves are at fault and so is replacing them =
all. Please leave you rooms unlocked so he can access the showers.

I will be there too.

Cheers,

Mark
